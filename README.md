## Answer for Commit 2
* How is Git/GitHub relevant to me at all?
  * First off, Git and GitHub are two different things. Git is a versioning system while GitHub is a repository.
  Git is most useful when you are developing a project. Through it, you can be sure that you are always able to have a working version of your system available.
  GitHub is a good way to work collaboratively since it is a Git remote repository for your system.
